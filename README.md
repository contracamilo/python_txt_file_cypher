# ACTIVITY 6: Final Project

Firstly, you must make three decisions:

1. Work in groups of no more than 5 people.
2. Select a programming language covered in the course to work on the final project.
3. Choose the theme or idea for the project. What problem do you want to solve with the project? This theme or idea should allow you to develop a program where you apply the programming concepts seen within the framework of a real-world issue, problem, or idea. This theme or idea should be broad enough to implement the topics covered in the course but not so extensive that it prevents you from completing the project in the scheduled time, and it must be taken from a real context, that is, something that can be applied to everyday life. Some ideas might be:
   - A product registration system for a store where the available quantity of each product is calculated, products can be "sold" (subtract the products from the record), and the total of a sale can be calculated.
   - Payroll management.
   - A program that allows data to be encrypted so that it can be transmitted more securely.

Note: The project must make use of the following concepts: Data input and output, conditional handling, repetitive cycles, use and definition of functions, graphical user interface.

Format: Source code, executable, and MP4 video (presentation of project operation).

Development: Group of a maximum of 5 students.

Deliverable: Compressed folder that contains the developed code, executable code, and video (max. 3 minutes) that shows the behavior of the developed program.
